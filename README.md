# Erasure-Code-module-in-hadoop-3.0.0
Process flow/logic of core functionalites in the EC module

Documentation of EC module and basic ideas like striping, encode/decode, native code support, reconstruction process flow are provided.
These were created following the JIRAs realted to erasure coding support in Hadoop-3.0.0 and the source code of the project.

Hope this helps developers who want to follow the erasure coding support feature in Hadoop-3.0.0.
These documents are my understanding of the functions, so kindly let me know if you notice any mistakes.

Thanks!
